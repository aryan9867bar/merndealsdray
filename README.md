This is a MERN stack application designed to manage and display employee information, including authentication features.


Technical Description:

The Employee Management System is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application designed to streamline the process of managing employee data within an organization. 
The backend, built with Node.js and Express.js, serves as the API endpoint for CRUD operations on employee records, leveraging MongoDB as the database for persistent data storage. 
RESTful routes are implemented to handle requests for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee information. User authentication and authorization are enforced using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) 
to ensure secure access to the system. On the frontend, React.js is utilized to develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with employee data. The frontend components are structured to enable 
seamless navigation and efficient data management, providing features such as employee listing, creation, editing, and deletion. The UI is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring optimal display 
across various devices and screen sizes. Additionally, client-side form validation is implemented to enhance data integrity and user experience. Furthermore, the application incorporates additional functionalities 
such as search and pagination to facilitate efficient data retrieval and navigation. The use of modern web development tools and practices, including Axios for handling HTTP requests, Bootstrap for styling, and 
React Router for client-side routing, contributes to the scalability, maintainability, and extensibility of the project. Overall, the Employee Management System offers a robust solution for organizations to manage 
their employee information effectively and securely.
